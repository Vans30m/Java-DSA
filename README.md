# Java DSA (LeetCode Solutions)

All DSA questions solved by me on different platforms — primarily **LeetCode** — using **Java**.

## Repository Goals
- Maintain clean, well-structured solutions to the problems I solve
- Track progress and revisions over time
- Keep explanations and complexity notes for quick revision

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java
- **Focus Areas:** Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

## Naming Convention
Suggested file format:

`<problemNumber> - <ProblemName>_/<Question>`
`<problemNumber> - <ProblemName>_/<Answer>`

Examples:
- `1-TwoSum/Question`
- `1-TwoSum/Answer`


## Progress Tracking
I may optionally add a tracker (by topic / difficulty) as I solve more problems.

## How to Run (Optional)
If you want to run solutions locally:
1. Install Java (JDK 17+ recommended).
2. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   java FileName
   ```

> Note: Many LeetCode solutions are written as a `class Solution` and may need a small `main` wrapper to run locally.

## Disclaimer
These are my own solutions for learning and revision. There can be multiple valid approaches to the same problem.
